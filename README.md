## Plantshare Laravel

This is a social network site built in laravel. The main purpose is to add plants to your profile, then share that profile with friends. You can make blog posts, share images, follow friends, get a friends posts timeline, and name your plants for your profile. It is demonstration of the functionality of laravel, with a tailwind css frontend with some javascript/jquery for functionality. This is for personal practice and is a work in progress. 

The same app built with django/Python can be found pinned in my portfolio
